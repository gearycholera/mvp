There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
<!-- Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.-->
   Is That The Dude From...

## Sub-Heading ##
<!--Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
   If you're watching a movie and think an actor was in another movie you saw, but you aren't really sure... check out ITTDF!

## Summary ##
<!--Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
   ITTDF can help you quickly identify if the actor you kinda recognize was also in that one movie you saw wayyy back and only vaguely remember.

## Problem ##
<!--Describe the problem your product solves. -->
   Comparing casts between movies has always been a chore. While sites like IMDB and TMDB show a lot of information for individual movies, comparing two films has required you to have two tabs open and manually scanning each list one at a time. What a nightmare!

## Solution ##
<!--Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
   ITTDF quickly analyzes cast/crew from movies and finds out which ones have worked together before, so you don't have to! Welcome to the future!

## Quote from You ##
<!--A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
   "Growing up as a child of Indian immigrants, I had to watch a lot of movies and figure out if one of the actors in the movie I was watching was the same dude from that other movie I saw a little while ago. Everyday was a struggle. I'm afraid to say, the relentless pressure to quickly and accurately identify actors pushed me over the edge...

  Until I decided to take my life back! 

  I was resolved to create a solution to put an end to this nightmare that has plagued so many immigrant children from Stockton, California. I have spent literally DOZENS of hours programming and now, I am proud to present to you and the world, 'Is That The Dude From...'"

## How to Get Started ##
<!--Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
   Just enter the name of the movie you're watching, and the name of the movie you think the dude might be from, and Viola!

## Customer Quote ##
<!--Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
   "Yeah... It definitely came in handy that one time."
  
   - Dave C.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
<!--Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
   We at ITTDF have always believed in a brighter and less mentally-exhausting future
  Why spend time pondering over an actor's filmography when you could be spending time with your loved ones?
  You do love them, right?!
  
  Checkout Is That The Dude From... and help us create a new era of film cast/crew comparsions!
